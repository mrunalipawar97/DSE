# INFO 6105 : Data Science Engineering Methods

## Course Description

Introduces the core concepts of machine learning with a unique emphasis on computational biology. This
course covers all foundational topics typically addressed in an introductory machine learning course, but
all examples and case studies are rooted in biology and medicine. Students will gain a comprehensive
understanding of various machine learning algorithms, their implementation, evaluation, and best
practices. They will delve into the intricacies of how learning models are formulated from intricate data
pipelines, both from an algorithmic and practical perspective.

### Topics include:
* Supervised learning (parametric/nonparametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural
networks, deep learning).
* Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems).
* All case studies and real-world examples provided will draw from biological and medical datasets,
allowing students to apply machine learning techniques to relevant challenges in the fields of biology
and medicine.
